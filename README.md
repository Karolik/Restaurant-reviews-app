## Project Overview

In the **Restaurant Reviews** project, a static webpage has been converted to a mobile-ready web application. In this project, a static design that lacked accessibility has been converted to be:
- _responsive_ on different sized displays,
- _accessible_ for screen reader use,
- and _a service worker_ has been added to create an offline experience for the app's users.

 The code provided for this website had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

### Prerequisites / Instructions to open the app

You need to have access to the Internet and a browser installed (preferably Google Chrome).

To open the page:

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

When Python already installed, in the terminal write cd 'your folder path' and then inside your folder: python -m http.server 8000.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
